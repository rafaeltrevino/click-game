# Loop Fruits

This memory game keeps track of images that the user has clicked on. Whenever the user clicks on an image twice, his/her points are reverted to zero, the top score is kept, and he/she can try again. Images are randomized on each attempt.

The application features the use of [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building the user interface.
